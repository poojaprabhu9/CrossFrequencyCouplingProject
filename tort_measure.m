%
% Returns a value (or vector of values) for the  measure calculated
% between two signals. Signals may contain one of more trials. Multiple
% trials may be averaged so as to return one pac value or a vector of
% pac values calculated for each trial may be returned, depending on the 
% 'avg' argument. Signals should be passed as column vectors, multiple 
% trials stored as multiple columns.
%
% INPUTS:
% ph_sig - signal filtered for a lower, modulating frequency (e.g. theta
% band oscillations)
%
% amp_sig - signal filtered for a higher, modulated frequency (e.g. gamma
% band oscillations)
%
% avg - string, either 'y' or 'n', determines whether values are
% averaged over trials or returned as a vector
